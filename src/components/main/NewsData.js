    text: "On February 24, we mark a year of the beginning of  barbaric russian full scale  invasion of Ukraine. It is a year of heroic resistance, determination and sacrifice. A year of pain and suffering. A year of unity of the civilized world against modern manifestation of absolute evil. It is also a year since the activities of our volunteer organization started. With the help of Sweden, the Swedish people and everyone who supports us, we managed to collect more than 2 000 000 sek for help to those in need. We have sent almost 300 tons of humanitarian aid to Ukraine for people affected by the war and people defending Ukraine. Thank you to everyone who stands side by side with us in this fight! Thank you, Sweden! We will stand until the end, until our Victory! Glory to Ukraine!",
