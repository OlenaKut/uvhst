We help hospitals in Ukraine, orphanages, people who suffered from war and soldiers at the front. During our work, we collected more than SEK 2 million and sent about 100 trucks with humanitarian aid to Ukraine. Now we are trying to collect more things that will help in Ukraine with light and heat - generators, heaters, flashlights, candles, warm things, as well as food and hygiene items. We are convinced that every donation is important and can save someone's life.",
