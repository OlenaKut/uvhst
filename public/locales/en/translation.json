  "text-main": "Ukrainian Volunteer Hub Stockholm is a team of volunteers who have come together since the first days of the war to help Ukraine. We help hospitals in Ukraine, orphanages, people who suffered from war and soldiers at the front. During our work, we collected more than SEK 2 million and sent about 100 trucks with humanitarian aid to Ukraine. Now we are trying to collect more things that will help in Ukraine with light and heat - generators, heaters, flashlights, candles, warm things, as well as food and hygiene items. We are convinced that every donation is important and can save someone's life.",
